During my third year of engineering, one of my course requirements was to choose an area of domain under the supervision of our professor for the mini-project module.
We (a group of 3) took this opportunity to showcase our skills and technical knowledge by choosing the domain of blockchain technology. We decided to revolutionize traditional physical cryptocurrency ATMs to make them more accessible and affordable via the TRON network, which kept costs to a minimum and ensured uninterrupted transaction flow, keeping the user and service provider at ease.
Assuming the role of project lead, I guided my team through various stages of development, from writing documentation to constructing the front end (website) to handling the back end, where our functionality came to life. Leveraging the power of Binance (Exchange) and PayTM (Indian Payment gateway) APIs, we integrated critical components.
Capitalizing on the crypto craze at the time and supported by the resounding success of our live demonstration on a production level, our project was awarded the highest grade in our class & furthermore, it wowed our peers during a tech-fest where we won 1st place, A Truly Inspirational Journey for us.
